## [1.2.2] - (in progress)

### Added
- **Collections Creation**:
  - Added option to create collections from synced catalogs

### Changed
- Disabled Mirror Sync option if catalog is not marked for syncing to prevent confusion

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Mirror Sync for Synced Catalogs**:
  - New option for one-way (mirror) sync behavior, i.e. local files will be deleted if they no longer exist on the catalog
  - Added menu option to sync for quick access
  - Download/sync progress indicator
- **OPDS Metadata Sidecars**:
  - Successful downloads now write metadata sidecars for better integration with KOReader's library and file management features.
  - Sidecars include title, authors, series/index (when available), and summary metadata.
  - Metadata writing is integrated for direct downloads, queued downloads, and sync downloads.

### Changed

- **Sync Labels and Actions**:
  - Updated sync action labels in menus and dispatcher to clarify one-way mirror and force-overwrite behavior.
- **Catalog Schema**:
  - Added sync mode persistence and migration defaults for existing sync-enabled catalogs.
  - Added synced manifest persistence for safer stale-file detection.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Book Info Dialog**: Added a dedicated dialog with at-a-glance book metadata and improved cover handling.
- **Direct Sync Gesture Actions**: Added action-oriented gesture events for faster sync and navigation workflows.
- **Improved Cover Pipeline**: Added higher-quality cover loading with disk-backed cache and lifecycle-safe image handling.
- **New Cover Settings**:
  - Prefer Large Covers (quality-first source selection)
  - Enable Cover Cache toggle
  - Advanced cache controls: max size, TTL, and manual cache clear
- **Sync Dispatcher Integration**:
  - Added explicit dispatcher actions for `Sync all catalogs` and `Force sync all catalogs`
  - Supports direct invocation from KOReader gesture/action mapping

### Changed

- **Debug Architecture Refactor**:
  - Standardized debug logging through shared utility usage.
  - Extended state manager integration across UI menu components.
  - Removed obsolete facade/dead code and simplified loader signatures.
- **CI Maintenance**:
  - Updated GitHub Actions dependencies for checkout and artifact upload/download workflows.

### Fixed

- **Gesture Registration**: Fixed gesture registration failures (Issue #58).
- **Duplicate PDF Entries**: Prevented duplicate PDF files from being shown in results (Issue #57).
- **Book Info Dialog Stability**:
  - Fixed filename capture timing to avoid nil values.
  - Corrected cover widget and related dialog behavior.
  - Removed invalid imports and corrected build wiring.

### Notes

- This release includes merged community and maintenance pull requests together with issue-resolution fixes.
- Packaging layout improvements from prior releases are retained and compatible with the current codebase structure.
- New settings are available under **OPDS Plus Catalog → Settings → Cover Settings**.
- Sync actions can be used from catalog long-press workflows or mapped through KOReader dispatcher actions.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-18

### Added

- **Debug Mode Toggle**: Added developer setting to enable/disable verbose logging for troubleshooting
- **Version Display**: Plugin version now shown in settings menu ("About OPDS Plus v1.1.0")
- **Smart Text Truncation**: Titles and authors now display with ellipsis (…) when truncated
  - UTF-8 safe truncation for international characters
  - Word-aware truncation attempts to break at word boundaries
  - Binary search algorithm for optimal text fitting
- **Optimized Space Utilization**:
  - List view now dynamically adjusts cover sizes to minimize whitespace
  - Grid view automatically fits maximum rows based on available screen height
  - Smart calculations ensure complete items/tiles are always shown
  - Adaptive sizing works across all device screen sizes

### Changed

- **Improved List View Sizing**:
  - Preset sizes now target specific items per page (3, 4, 6, or 8 items)
  - Dynamically calculates optimal cover height to fill available space
  - Reduces wasted whitespace at bottom of screen
- **Improved Grid View Sizing**:
  - Preset layouts now target specific row counts for consistency
  - Automatically adds additional rows when space is available
  - No hardcoded row limits - scales infinitely on large displays
  - Grid borders and spacing optimized for better visual balance
- **Cleaned Up Debug Logging**:
  - Removed excessive debug output (banner separators, verbose logging)
  - All debug logging now conditional based on debug mode setting
  - Critical errors still logged regardless of debug mode
  - Significantly reduced log spam in production use

### Fixed

- **Release Package Structure**: GitHub Actions workflow now creates clean zip without nested directories
- **Template String Formatting**: Fixed `%%` appearing in confirmation dialogs (now displays as single `%`)
- **Loop Variable Conflicts**:
  - Fixed crashes in Grid Layout settings menu
  - Fixed crashes in Grid Border settings menu
  - Resolved variable name conflicts between gettext `_()` function and loop variables
- **Version Module Naming**: Renamed internal version module to avoid conflicts
- **Font Method Calls**: Corrected text width measurement to use proper KOReader API (`RenderText:sizeUtf8Text()`)

### Technical Improvements

- Conditional debug logging via `_debugLog()` method in all core modules
- Improved error handling and logging consistency
- Better separation of production vs. development logging
- Enhanced code maintainability with cleaner function signatures

### Performance

- Reduced UI lag from excessive logging in production
- Optimized text truncation algorithm using binary search
- Improved rendering performance with better whitespace calculations

### Notes

- Debug mode can be toggled in: **OPDS Plus Catalog → Settings → Developer → Debug Mode**
- Changes to view settings (cover sizes, grid layouts) apply when next browsing a catalog
- Compatible with all KOReader-supported devices and screen sizes
- Tested on e-readers, tablets, and desktop displays
